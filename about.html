					<p id="about">New Yorkers depend on <mark>bodegas</mark>.<sup>1</sup></p>
					<p id="about">They are an <mark>infrastructure of care</mark>. Beyond the sale of food and essential items,<sup>2</sup> bodegas are community bulletin boards, a collective pantry, an <em>after-school stop</em>.<sup>3</sup> They preserve the existing <mark>cultural memory</mark> of their surrounding community through food and language.<sup>4</sup></p>
					<p id="about">While the collective memory of a middle school is short (with students leaving after three years), bodegas hold the longer <mark>institutional memory</mark> of a neighborhood. Their daisy-chained siting generates a network of safety and care.<sup>5</sup></p>
					<p id="about">How is that infrastructure of safety <mark>maintained</mark>? It is not maintained by the police, whose visible presence intended to project “safety” belies what is actually violent but invisible. It is maintained by the community which—even among middle school students—is already engaged in practices of care.<sup>6</sup></p>
					<p id="about">The violence that the police expect to address is not what the community actually experiences. The real violence is found in failing boilers, in unsound elevators,<sup>7</sup> in gas leaks—in the power landlords hold over their tenants. Bodegas, and the communities they serve, are subject to the “<mark>regime of imperceptibility</mark>”<sup>8</sup> of Department of Buildings <em>viol</em>ations—and the <em>viol</em>ence<sup>9</sup> they represent.</p>
					<p id="about">The model of <mark>participatory budgeting</mark>—piloted in Brooklyn in 2011<sup>10</sup> and championed by current mayoral candidate and District 38 city council representative Carlos Menchaca<sup>11</sup>—offers an alternative way to address this “regime of imperceptibility.”<sup>12</sup> <mark>Budgets articulate value.</mark> They represent “what—and whom—our cities, counties, states, and country deem worthy of investment.”<sup>13</sup> We advocate for the value of care infrastructure.</p>
					<p id="about">Participatory budgeting requires as a first step a dedicated <mark>source of public funding</mark>. We propose to derive such a source for the District 15 community from the <mark>waterfront resources</mark> in Red Hook and Sunset Park. Along the waterfront, city- and privately-owned properties collect quarterly and annual DOB violations with no apparent recourse. In fact, we can put a dollar amount on the total amount owed: there are <mark>$_[TBD]_</mark> in outstanding violation fines as of today.<sup>14</sup></p>
					<p id="about">Most built before 1938, these waterfront buildings do not have Certificates of Occupancy<sup>15</sup> and therefore no motivation to pay off their fines.<sup>16</sup> These properties represent a knot in the capitalist system of values: primed for high-end development<sup>17</sup> (an appreciation in value) while facing impending flooding due to climate change<sup>18</sup> (a depreciation in value). Any new development will also require soil remediation due to the historic industrial pollution of the waterfront.</p>
					<p id="about">Using the money from DOB violations and impending flooding as leverage, we advocate for these unmaintained waterfront properties to be collected in the form of a <mark>Community Land Trust (CLT)</mark>, modeled on existing CLTs in the area<sup>19</sup>. Funding for the CLT could be allocated as a <mark>participatory budget project</mark>, supported by the “pot of money” collected from the cyclical recurrence of boiler (and other) violations. The environmental care infrastructures generated by a CLT are rooted in <mark>education</mark>—for example, the New York Harbor School and its “Billion Oyster Project”<sup>20</sup>—and offer climate resiliency through soil remediation, landscape design, and community gardening.</p>
					<p id="about">These leveraged and newly constructed resources—from funding, to food, to material waste streams—can be funneled into the infrastructure of bodegas. We propose to create a bodega <mark>maintenance manual</mark> which will synthesize and strategize the potential uses of these resources. Volume 1 will pertain to bodega tenants: community fridges,<sup>21</sup> sidewalk furniture, storefront visibility, and zine printing. Volume 2 will pertain to landlords: low-pressure boiler inspector education,<sup>22</sup> ventilation, plumbing, and gas maintenance. Volume 3 will pertain to the community and the CLT: soil remediation, gardening, and food cultivation.</p>
					<p id="about">The maintenance manual aims to supplement the existing infrastructures of care in bodegas, using <em>architectural investigation as a form of advocacy</em> for the Sunset Park community.</p>
