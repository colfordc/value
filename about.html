					<p id="about">We are in <mark>Sunset Park</mark>—the fourth largest neighborhood in Brooklyn, home to 130,000 people.</p>
					
					<p id="about">The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and the industrial waterfront are its infrastructural landmarks. But there are many others—parks, schools, bodegas.<sup>1</sup></p>
					
					<p id="about">The <mark>health, safety, and welfare</mark> of this community—particularly that of middle school children—is maintained in many ways. We will focus on two: <mark>environmental infrastructure</mark>, and <mark>care infrastructure</mark>. These, in turn, can be understood at multiple <em>scales</em>.</p>

					<p id="about">Environments and care are tended to through communal relationships. Bodegas are an infrastructure of care<sup>2</sup> which preserve <mark>cultural memory</mark> through food and language.<sup>3</sup> Students gravitate there after school. Though they will leave middle school after three years, the bodega is there for much longer, holding the <mark>institutional memory</mark> that middle school cannot.</p>

					<p id="about">But our current economy treats health, safety, and welfare as something to be calculated, outsourced, taxonomized. This <em>abstraction induces harm</em><sup>4</sup>—harm that is often invisible. Communal acts of disruption reveal <mark>regimes of imperceptibility</mark>.<sup>5</sup></p>

					<p id="about"><em>How can architects respond to the harm inflicted on health, safety, and welfare in Sunset Park?</em></p>

					<p id="about">We suggest that it is by <mark>unearthing</mark><sup>6</sup>—using architecture to bear witness to the past, revealing invisible violence in the city—and by <mark>attending</mark><sup>7</sup> to the future—cultivating care by tending to the imagination of students.</p>

					<p id="about">The first stake in the ground: <em>make the invisible visible</em>. Dismantle and disrupt regimes of imperceptibility.</p> 

					<p id="about"><mark>Bear witness to past harms</mark> in two ways: materialize ecological damage at the scale of the climate<sup>8</sup>; and substantiate unjust relationships between tenant and landlord through building violations.<sup>9</sup></p>

					<p id="about"><mark>Bear witness to the future</mark>: amplify bodega infrastructure to serve communal relationships of care<sup>10</sup>; encourage the work and imagination of students to amplify their agency in building a just future.</p>
