					<p id="home">Leverage the existing system of <mark>building violations</mark> to generate capital. Along the waterfront, city- and privately-owned properties collect quarterly and annual DOB violations with no apparent recourse. Having introduced DOB archives in Tempo 1, the community can unearth these violations and advocate for the dedication of this <mark>capital towards community infrastructure</mark>.</p>
