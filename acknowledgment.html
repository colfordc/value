						The D15 Diversity Report organizes its recommendations within two themes: Integration and Inclusion. We ask: <mark>how can integration happen on the students' own terms?</mark> What would it mean for a student not to <i>be</i> integrated but <i>to integrate</i>?
						<br><br>
						For this to happen, students must cultivate their own agency. Our project speculates on <mark>the forms that empowerment might take</mark>.
						<br><br>
						We looked to a wide range of <mark>activist practices</mark>—from data scientists to visual artists to landscape architects. We learned from the ways they interpreted racial justice as both a <mark>physical and embodied</mark> project, as well as a <mark>social and institutional</mark> one.
						<br><br>
						As students interrogating the role of architecture in the project of racial integration, we have engaged a hybrid practice of research and design to imagine more just futures.

				<p id="about">We are in Sunset Park—the fourth largest neighborhood in Brooklyn. The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and the industrial waterfront are its infrastructural landmarks. But there are many others—parks, schools, bodegas. The health, safety, and welfare of this community—particularly that of middle school children—is maintained in two key ways: environmental infrastructure (at the scales of the building and the climate) and care infrastructure (cultural memory and institutional memory). But the economic and bureaucratic abstraction of health, safety, and welfare from its context has induced harm—harm that is often invisible.
				<br>
				How can architects respond to the harm inflicted on health, safety, and welfare in Sunset Park?
				<br>
				Architects can do so by unearthing—using architecture to bear witness to both the past, revealing invisible violence in the city, and to the future, by engaging and rendering imagination.
