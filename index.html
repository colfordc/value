					<p>New Yorkers depend on bodegas.</p>

					<p>They are an infrastructure of care. Beyond the sale of food and essential items, bodegas are community bulletin boards, an after school stop, pantries, even an extended family. They preserve the cultural memory of their surrounding community through food and language and create a network of intimate safe spaces within the immensity of the city.</p>

					<p>The violence that the police expect to address is not what the community actually experiences. The real violence is found in failing boilers, in unsound elevators, in gas leaks—in the power landlords hold over their tenants. Bodegas, and the communities they serve, are subject to the “regime of imperceptibility” of Department of Buildings violations—and the violence they represent.</p>

					<p>The model of participatory budgeting—piloted in Brooklyn in 2011 and championed by current mayoral candidate and District 38 city council representative Carlos Menchaca—offers an alternative way to address this “regime of imperceptibility.” Budgets articulate value. They represent “what—and whom—our cities, counties, states, and country deem worthy of investment.” We advocate for the value of care infrastructure.</p>

					<p>Participatory budgeting requires as a first step a dedicated source of public funding. We propose to derive such a source for the District 15 community from the waterfront resources in Red Hook and Sunset Park. Along the waterfront, city- and privately-owned properties collect quarterly and annual DOB violations with no apparent recourse. In fact, we can put a dollar amount on the total amount owed: there are $_[TBD]_ in outstanding violation fines as of today.</p>
