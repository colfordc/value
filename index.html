				<p id="about">We are in Sunset Park—the fourth largest neighborhood in Brooklyn. The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and the industrial waterfront are its infrastructural landmarks. But there are many others—parks, schools, bodegas. The health, safety, and welfare of this community—particularly that of middle school children—is maintained in two key ways: environmental infrastructure (at the scales of the building and the climate) and care infrastructure (cultural memory and institutional memory). But the economic and bureaucratic abstraction of health, safety, and welfare from its context has induced harm—harm that is often invisible.
				<br>
				How can architects respond to the harm inflicted on health, safety, and welfare in Sunset Park?
				<br>
				Architects can do so by unearthing—using architecture to bear witness to both the past, revealing invisible violence in the city, and to the future, by engaging and rendering imagination.
